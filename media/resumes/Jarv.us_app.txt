Hi,

I am a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania coming from Kazakhstan. Throughout high school I was involved in competitive programming and learned a lot about algorithms and data structures. However, even though I successfully compete at the national level, I ultimately decided to follow my another interest and started studying business in college.

I enjoyed it at the beginning. However, after two semesters full of case discussions and presentations, I started feeling that something was missing. Finding myself overjoyed while helping a friend with CS homework one day, I realized that I liked programming too much not to make it a part of my life.

I started pursuing a CS minor and I am finally enjoying the analytical rigor that excites me. I spent my entire winter break learning Python, and it was one of the most fun breaks I ever had. I discovered web development by participating in PennApps and it was cool to be able to see the fruits of my labor as a shiny website rather than a couple of lines in an output file. I got really hooked, and I want to learn more. I learned the fundamentals of front-end and am currently learning JavaScript with the intention to do back-end with it too (Meteor, here I come). Let's have fun together!

I expect to learn a ton, to be exact - to be able to build fairly sophisticated web applications on my own by the end of the summer.

I expect to learn on my own by figuring out the ways to do the task at hand and by proposing and implementing features and functions.

I expect to receive some support when I'm stuck.

My greatest ambition in life is to be a grand-grand-father and to remain functional being so:)
